# Angular Practice

This morning's review session will be a little different than others. Rather than go over Angular as a class, you will have a choice of three activities (listed below).  

Instructors will be available to answer questions in the classroom, regardless of which option you choose.  

## Superhero Phonebook (Beginner)

In [this exercise](http://hannahhoward.github.io/angular-starter-wdi/), you will build a basic Angular app. Choose this option if you would like practice with any of the following...
* `ng-app`
* `ng-repeat`
* `ng-model`
* `ng-filter`
* `ng-class`
* `ng-click`

This exercise does not make use of any additional Angular modules like `ui-router` or `ngResource`.

> NOTE: The bonuses require Angular modules that we will not be teaching you in WDI.  

## Build a Social Network (Advanced)

In [this exercise](http://hannahhoward.github.io/angular-intermediate-wdi/) you will combine your knowledge of basic Angular with additional modules like `ui-router` and `ngResource` to build a social network.
